# My Data Science Learning Journey

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to my career transition into Data Science. As someone with a Master's degree in Physics and 2 years of experience as a Software Engineer in biotech, I'm now leveraging my analytical and coding background to dive deep into the world of data.

This repository will serve as a living portfolio of my learning progress, practice exercises, and small projects. My goal is to solidify my foundational data science skills over the next 6 months.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

* **Python for Data Science:** Master core libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
* **SQL:** Become proficient in querying and managing data in relational databases.
* **Statistics & Probability:** Solidify understanding of statistical concepts essential for data analysis and machine learning.
* **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** Build intuition and practical skills with basic ML algorithms.
* **Real-world Projects:** Apply learned concepts to solve practical data problems, especially those relevant to biotech/life sciences.

## ðŸš€ Repository Structure

This repository is organized by learning domain to make navigation easy:

-   `01_Python_Fundamentals/`: Notebooks focusing on NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
-   `02_SQL_Practice/`: `.sql` files with practice queries and solutions.
-   `03_Statistics_Exercises/`: Notebooks exploring statistical concepts and simulations in Python.
-   `04_Data_Visualization/`: Notebooks dedicated to creating insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
-   `05_Mini_Projects/`: Small, end-to-end data analysis or machine learning projects.
-   `data/`: (Optional) Contains small datasets used in exercises. Larger datasets will be linked.

## ðŸ“š Resources I'm Using

I'm primarily learning from these excellent (and mostly free!) books:

* **Python Data Science Handbook** by Jake VanderPlas [[Link](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)]
* **Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis in Python** by Allen B. Downey [[Link](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/)]
* **An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR)** by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (conceptual understanding) [[Link](https://www.statlearning.com/)]
* **W3Schools SQL Tutorial** [[Link](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)] for core SQL syntax.
* **SQLZoo** [[Link](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)] for interactive SQL practice.

## âœ¨ Progress Highlights

**(You can update this section periodically)**

* **Week 1 (June 2025):** Solidified NumPy and Pandas basics. Learned advanced data manipulation, merging, and grouping.
* **Week 2 (June 2025):** Gained proficiency in Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. Started strong with SQL `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `JOIN` clauses.
* ... (add more as you progress through months)
